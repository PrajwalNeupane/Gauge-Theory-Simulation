# **Quantum Gauge Theory Simulation**

This project simulates a 1+1d ùëç2 gauge theory with staggered fermionic matter, inspired by Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). The goal is to explore the dynamics of electron and positron systems on a lattice, implemented on a quantum computing platform.

## **Project Overview**
This project extends the work described in the paper [arXiv:1903.08807](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08807) to actual quantum devices. The simulation uses trotterization to model the time evolution of a 1+1d ùëç2 gauge theory, focusing on the interaction of fermionic matter (electrons and positrons) on a discretized lattice.

### **Key Features**
- **Trotterization:** Applied to simulate the quantum dynamics over time.
- **Quantum Circuit Implementation:** Leveraged Qiskit to design and execute the simulation on a quantum computer.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Performed on the noisy output data to extract meaningful results.

## **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.7+
- Qiskit
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive use)

## **Installation**
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/quantum-gauge-theory-simulation.git
cd quantum-gauge-theory-simulation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Usage**
Run the simulation script to execute the quantum gauge theory model:

```bash
python simulate_gauge_theory.py
```

For interactive exploration, you can use the provided Jupyter notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## **Methodology**
The project simulates a 1+1d ùëç2 gauge theory by:
1. **Formulating the Hamiltonian** for the system.
2. **Applying Trotterization** to decompose the time evolution operator.
3. **Implementing the quantum circuit** using Qiskit, representing fermions on alternating lattice sites and photons on lattice links.
4. **Running the simulation** on a quantum device, such as IBM Quantum Experience.
5. **Performing statistical analysis** on the noisy output data to refine the results.

## **Results**
The results of the simulation include data visualizations and statistical analyses that compare the quantum simulation outputs to theoretical predictions. These results contribute to the ongoing research in lattice field theory and quantum simulations.
